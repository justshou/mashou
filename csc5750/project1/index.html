    <h2>More about me</h2>
    <p>
      My favorite sport is probably
      <span class="bold-and-green">football</span>. I just started watching it a
      few years ago because of my friends, but now that I understand how the
      game works, it's a lot of fun to watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite TV show is <span class="bold-and-green">The Sopranos</span>. I
      just watched a few years ago for the first time, and I see exactly why
      people before me loved it so much. I already loved Breaking Bad, and I
      feel like it had the same type of story to it, but it was just another
      level of interesting. I also think mob shows are cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favorite video game is <span class="bold-and-green">VALORANT</span>. I
      have a love-hate relationship with it, as sometimes I get on and I'm
      really good, and other times I am really bad! But overall, it's probably
      the game I've spent the most time on besides Minecraft. Here is the link
      to my minecraft NameMC:
