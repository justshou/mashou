    <p>Here are the classes I am taking this semester, but more in depth:</p>

    <h2>MAT 2030 - Calculus III</h2>
    <p>
      This is <span class="required">required</span> for my major. I already had
      taken it before, but I dropped it because my professor for the class
      taught poorly, and skipped the first 2 weeks of class for a 'business
      trip', and left us students with no material or substitute. I am now
      taking it with Professor Buckman, and he is a great professor who makes
      sure his students learn.
    </p>

    <h2>CSC 4500 - Theoretical Computer Science</h2>
    <p>
      This is <span class="required">required</span> for my major as well. I
      don't really enjoy the class. I think the lecture isn't good, and the
      material could be taught much better.
    </p>

    <h2>CSC 5752 - Cyber Security</h2>
    <p>
      This is an elective class, and I'm taking it because after this semester,
      I am graduating and going to work IT at Rocket Mortgage, so I thought it
      would be good to get experience in cyber security because of it. <br />
      So far, our only project has been using a virtual machine to run
      WireShark.
    </p>

    <h2>CSC 5750 - Web Technology</h2>
    <p>
      That is this class! I am enjoying the class, and this is our first project
      so far. I have taken classes with Professor Nasser before (CSC 1100,
      4310), and they were some of my favorite classes to take at Wayne State.
    </p>

    <h2>CSC 4996 - Senior Capstone</h2>
    <p>
      This is also a <span class="required">required</span> class for my major,
      and it is tough. My current project with my group is to design an app that
      uses a YOLOv8n model to detect drowsiness in a driver, and provide alerts
      to the driver in order to wake them up or make them more attentive. We are
      using Python and Java for the project, and we are using Android Studio to
      design the app.
    </p>

    <h2>Noteworthy Projects</h2>
    <h3>ChillSpot</h3>
    <p>
      ChillSpot is a projected I worked on with a few friends in CSC 4110 -
      Software Engineering. It is a web-based application that allows students
      on campus to find spots to chill on campus. It has a frontend build in
      BootStrap, and a backend built in Java.
    </p>

    <h3>YOLOv8n Drowsiness Detection App</h3>
    <p>
      This is the project I am currently working on in my Senior Capstone class.
      It is an app that uses a YOLOv8n model to detect drowsiness in a driver,
      and provide alerts to the driver in order to wake them up or make them
      more attentive. We are using Python and Java for the project, and the
      frontend is built using Android Studio (which I learned from 4310!)
